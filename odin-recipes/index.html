                    <br>
                    <p class="recipe_desc">Pinoy Spaghetti is the Filipino version of the ever popular pasta that is of Italian origin. This version of Spaghetti requires the use of sugar, hotdogs, and banana catsup. It might some peculiar to some but these ingredients brings up a whole new flavor that is totally Filipino.
                        Being loved mostly by the young ones, every kiddie party wont be complete without this dish. </p>

                    <p class="recipe_desc">Everybody has their own preferences when it comes to pasta. You could lean towards the thicker kind or the thinner one, or perhaps hold more love towards red sauce over the white variety. But a recipe that people can often agree on is Pasta Carbonara. We have a plethora of delicious tomato-based pasta dishes, but many also definitely love the milder, but also rich taste of this recipe’s egg-based sauce. Its largely savory, and often less overpowering flavor has won over many people’s hearts. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="recipe_desc">I love lasagna! It is rich, tasty, and delicious. I like to pair it with a piece of garlic bread (and spread lots of extra butter on top of the bread). One of my favorite versions is the one with the sweet meat sauce, with sliced hotdogs. The sauce is cooked the same way as that of Filipino Spaghetti. I simply call it, Filipino Style Lasagna.</p>
